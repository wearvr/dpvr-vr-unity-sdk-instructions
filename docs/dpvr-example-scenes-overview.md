# DPVR Unity VR SDK example scenes

The DPVR Plugin (as of 2.7.4) comes with a number of example scenes. Each is described here, to explain what benefits they can provide to developers looking for code examples to work from.

## Example scenes

Each example scene is located within the DPVR plugin, within the 'DPN' folder and at the specified file location.

### DpnDaydream
