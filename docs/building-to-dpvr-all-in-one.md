# Creating Unity builds for the DPVR All-In-One P1

## Build settings

Building directly to a headset is the recommended method of running your app.

As the DPVR operating system is an Android derivative, the build platform for your project must be set to **Android**.

This can be done via the **File › Build Settings** menu option.

Select **Android** and then click the **Switch Platform** button.
